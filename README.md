## Project 4: The Ising model in two dimensions

#### Abstract
In this project we study the Ising model in two dimensions without an external magnetic field. Calculations are run using the Monte Carlo method with 1 000 000 cycles.

The project consists of the following folders and files:

##### Datasets
Collection of all data runs.

##### Project 4
Program files: Main program and plotting program.
